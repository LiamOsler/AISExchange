## About 
AISExchange was created with the intention of creating a free and open source platform for the exchange of AIS data.

### What is AIS?
Automatic Identification Systems are a set of technologies that use transponders on ships to broadcast their identity, position, course and speed to other ships, coastal stations and satellites. This information is used by ships to avoid collisions, by port authorities to manage port operations, and by commercial organizations to track and manage their fleets.

### How does AIS typically work?
Commercial vessels carry purpose-built AIS transponders. The signal broadcast by these transponders is received by other ships, coastal stations and satellites. The signal is then decoded and the information is displayed on the bridge of the receiving vessel.

### Who uses AIS?
According to *SOLAS Regulation V/19* All vessels over 300 gross tons engaged in international voyages are required to carry an AIS transponder. Cargo ships of 500 gross tonnage and upwards not engaged in international voyages and all passengers ships irrespective of size. A flag state may exempt from this requirement for certain vessels.  [International Maritime Organization](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Pages/AIS.aspx#:~:text=The%20regulation%20requires%20AIS%20to,passenger%20ships%20irrespective%20of%20size.)


### AIS for small craft operators and recreational boaters
Dedicated hardware systems are installed on thousands of vessels. Unfortunately, these kinds of systems are expensive for small vessels to install. AISExchange is a free and open source platform that allows small craft operators and recreational boaters to share their AIS data over the mobile network using a comparatively inexpensive smartphone.

### AISExchange Location Beacon Application
A mobile application based on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) will be developed that allows users to share their position data over the mobile network. The application will first be available for Android, then iOS. The application will be available for free on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

## AISExchange User Platform
AISExchange Beacon allows you to share your position data over the internet to the AISExchange Network. This means you can broadcast your position over mobile data, WiFi or through a wired connection. This allows you to share your position  with AISExchange servers.

## Why create AISExchange?
There is a lack of free and open source platforms for the exchange of AIS data. AISExchange is an attempt to create a free and open source platform for the exchange of user generated AIS data. AISExchange will allow users to broadcast their position using a smartphone

## Safety
The authors of AISExchange advise all users to practice safe boating and to be acutely aware of the risks associated with the operation of personal or commercial watercraft. The authors of AISExchange advise all users to be aware of the laws and regulations in their area with respect to the operation of personal or commercial watercraft. Always carry the appropriate safety equipment for your vessel and maintain full situational awareness when operating it.
